### Where can I download games? <a class="permalink" href="#games">∞</a>

While we cannot officially recommend any single site for downloading Game Boy and Game Boy Color ROMs, we suggest using [Google](https://google.com) to search for ROMs by title.

_Please remember that downloading copied ROMs is illegal: only use images for ROMs you own._

### How do I add artwork? <a class="permalink" href="#artwork">∞</a>

1. Add some ROMs to Game Play Color as described [above](#add).

2. Download an image of the cover art for your ROM you wish to add artwork to.

3. Rename the file to match the name of the ROM. For example, if your ROM file is entitield **Shantae.gbc**, rename the artwork to **Shantae.jpg**.

### How do I change the console color? <a class="permalink" href="#color">∞</a>

Like the original Game Boy Color, Game Play Color is available in a range of colors. You can change these from the **Settings** dialog.

<a id="save"></a>

### Can I save games with Game Play Color? <a class="permalink" href="#save">∞</a>

Yes. Game Play Color supports saving games as implemented in the original ROMs. Simply save each game as you would on an original Game Boy or Game Boy Color.

_For example, to save your game in **Pokémon**, tap **Select** during game-play, select **SAVE** from the menu, then choose **YES** to save._

Note: Saved games are currently stored on the device and are not backed up to Google Drive. Removing Game Play Color from your home screen will delete your saved games. We're exploring saving game state on Google Drive in future updates.

### Why does my game restart every time I switch apps? <a class="permalink" href="#background">∞</a>

Unfortunately, due to the limitations of iOS, it's not possible to know when web applications (like Game Play Color) are about to be backgrounded. This means we are unable to automatically take a snapshot when you switch apps (e.g., to reply to a text message, take a phone call, etc).

Game Boy Color games which support saving will correctly [remember your last save](#save), but Game Boy games will be restarted.

We hope to add support for manual restore points in future versions of Game Play Color which should help mitigate this issue.
